## Still Learning, But Here’s What I Know About DSA
i’m gonna post some notes about data structures and algorithms here, hoping it can help other students who are learning DSA too. just so you know, these notes are based on how i understand things, so there might be mistakes or stuff that needs fixing. feel free to point out anything that’s wrong.

i’m still learning as well, so not everything’s perfect. just sharing what i got so far, maybe it helps someone. if you see something wrong or have a better way to explain, just tell me. i’m open to learning and getting better.

thanks in advance to anyone who checks this out and helps
